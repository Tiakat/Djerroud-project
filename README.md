**Voice and Linguistic Analysis to Determine Emotions in Friends' Interactions**
Welcome to my project, where I explore the intersection of voice analysis, linguistic analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) to uncover the emotions generated during interactions among friends. This project analyze speech patterns, text exchanges, and vocal nuances to detect and interpret emotional states and determine the closeness betweeen the characters.

Features:

Voice Analysis: Utilizes Praat for detailed spectrograms, pitch, formant analysis, and other acoustic features.
Emotion Detection: Employs OpenSmile for extracting vocal features and identifying emotional cues from speech.
Linguistic Analysis: Implements NLTK for tokenization, parsing, and sentiment analysis of textual interactions.
NLP Models: Integrates state-of-the-art models from SpeechBrain and Hugging Face for comprehensive speech and text processing.
Interactive Visualizations: Provides insights through visual representations of emotional states and linguistic patterns.
Goals:

To understand how friends' vocal expressions and word choices convey emotions.
To develop a robust system for real-time emotion detection and linguistic analysis.
To create a dataset and models that can be utilized for further research in social dynamics and emotional intelligence.
Join me in this journey of decoding the emotional landscapes of social interactions through the power of voice and linguistic analysis!
